### ðŸŽ¯ About The Project

Starting a new project with a specific stack, such as VILT (Vue, Inertia, Laravel, Tailwind), can be a time-consuming and repetitive process. Stacker solves this problem by automating the entire download and configuration process.

This project is intended for **developers** who value speed and efficiency, allowing them to launch a complete and functional development environment in minutes using pre-defined templates or custom configurations.

### âœ¨ Features

  * **Rapid Project Initialization:** Drastically reduces the initial setup time for a new project.
  * **Popular Stack Templates:** Comes with built-in support for ready-to-use stacks like VILT (Vue, Inertia, Laravel, Tailwind), TALL, and RILT.
  * **Custom Configuration:** Allows developers to use their own configuration files to standardize and accelerate the setup.
  * **Library Selection (In Development):** Will offer the flexibility to choose additional libraries during the project creation process.
